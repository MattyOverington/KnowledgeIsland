Splitting up of the Game.c functions brainstorm

Hector:

   isLegalAction:
      You wrote the tests so it's probs best if you write this one

Wez:

   

Matt:



Hard SETTERS:

   newGame

   This one in particular is difficult and time consuming

   makeAction

   Will be very time consuming but largely not entirely difficult
   Debugging this may be hard...

Moderate SETTERS:

   disposeGame

   Not too hard, just make sure all mallocs are paired with a free

   throwDice

   Again not too hard, especially with some clarification
   as to its function


Hard GETTERS:

   isLegalAction -> Sorry Hector... :/

   This/these functions actually require some difficult calculations

Moderate GETTERS:

   getDiscipline
   getDiceValue

   These won't really be very hard, especially if you make sure in
   newGame you index the list of pointers to region structs in the
   same order as the two parsed lists

   getCampus
   getARC

   These require some following of pointers but won't be *too* difficult
   Though following paths will require some working out
   Maybe one person just both of these ones as they are pretty similar

   getExchangeRate

   Again, hard but not ridiculously so, especially if all the retraining
   centres are in the same places. You could just store a path to each
   of the retraining centres and use getCampus to check if the player
   has one there.

Easy GETTERS:

   getMostARCs
   getMostPublications
   getTurnNumber
   getWhoseTurn
   getKPIpoints
   getARCs
   getCampuses
   getGO8s
   getIPs
   getPublications
   getStudents

   All of these have an atribute in one of the structs so thats easy
