Nope:
//Things To Do -
//   Matt your wrong
//   - Game.c
//      - Set up data storage
//         - Make structs for verts, edges and faces
//         - Methods for doing pointers between arrays for us (?)
//         - Other methods we think we'll need
//         - Make lists, finialse and done??
//         
//   - Testing Stuff
//      -???

To do for now (needs updating):
- Create structs for verts, edges, and regions in the .c
- Make the game struct then put it in the .h as Game
- Plan out how to do the list and pointers between them
- Create the functions 

Plan:
- Have a player struct that stores things like:
   - KPI
   - Papers
   - Patents
   - Different types of student
   - Etc. -- TODO fill in
- Vertex struct:
   - Owner (in other words, is there a campus on it, if so who owns it)
      - This would be a dumby value if noone owns it
      - Need to work out how to represent the owner
         - Pointer to struct?
         - Name? - This one seems the best to meh
         - idk... swag?
         - In the .h file there is a way of describing the owner of a campus with numbers that I think we have to use.
   - Is GO8 (the campus)
   - Etc. -- TODO fill in
- Verticy struct:
   - Owner (in other words, is there a grant on it, if so who owns it)
   - 
- Region
   - Student producer
   - Dice number
   - Etc. TODO fill in
